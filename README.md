Title: FiveToSeven

Description: Created an Api with four endpoints. The first end point is a MadLib, the second is "Odd or Even", and the last two reverses the user's input

Peer Reviewed by: Aidan Younathan

Peer Comment: Everything works as it should except for the small issue of the reversers both removing the first letter/number but its just an easy fix of swithcing your for loops from > to >= (ln 14 in ReverseAlphService and Ln 19 in ReverseNumService.). Other than that this is really good, good job dude!
